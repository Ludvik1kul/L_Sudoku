# L_Sudoku
Simple Recursive Sudoku Solver In Python.
Used to solve this https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/ problem. Beats 75% of valid Python3 submissions.
Very imporant! Will not return a solved board or anything meaningful if the board cannot be solved. Potentially run a really long time before finishing.

Define the board you want to be solved by making changes to "board", first entry in
the list is the top line in the Sudoku.
Then run the search(0,0) to begin solving.
Ends by printing the solved board.


#To do in the future
1. Add a function to reject unsolvable boards.
2. Add a function to change the board size.
